Global plastic production:
Over the last 70 years, plastic production has increased over 230 times, from 2 million tons per year in the 1950's to over 400 million tons in 2019.
Just in the last 20 years, the global production of plastic has doubled.

Plastic waste by disposal method:
While the production of plastic is increasing, so it is the amount of plastic waste, reaching almost 35 million tons in 2018. 
Unfortunately, only a small amount of this waste is recycled (around 9%), while most of it is still landfilled. 
A big part is also mismanaged, which include being burned in open pits, dumped into the sea, or disposed of in unsanitary landfills and dumpsites. 

Mismanaged plastic waste:
Mismanaged waste is always at risk of leaking to the enviroment. While rich countries tend to produce the most plastic waste per person, the amount of mismanaged waste tends to be higher in low-to-middle income countries. 
This is because these countries tend to have less developed waste management infrastructure.
