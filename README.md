# Plastic Pollution Info Page Project

This project was built to address the issue of plastic pollution.
It is designed to inform about the damaging effects of plastic pollution and what kinds of plastic are better than others.

## Data science section

As part of the project we tried to find reliable data about plastic pollution and visualise this data in an interesting way.
The data section can be found under the 'Country Data' page of the site.

## Tech stack

* The app is built in React, using bootstrap as a CSS framework.
* All data analysis is run in python.

## Title: 
Making an informative website showing the scale and impact of plastic waste and what can be done to tackle this problem.
The team:

Mentors:
Davide Laezza and Jorge Andre

## Precise project summary
This project aims to inform the visitor of the website about the scale and damage caused by plastic pollution. This is achieved through building a modern, well-designed website that concisely delivers information in way that can be easily understood. The project also includes a novel data analysis of available plastic pollution data. This aims to effectively represent data in a way that makes clear the dire situation of plastic pollution. While the problem is a global one, the website is aimed at European visitors. Data on specific countries has been limited to what is available from reliable sources.

## What was the idea/background of your project? 
The world produces 430 million tonnes of plastic per year. The majority of which has a short life cycle (1).  The devastating effects of this waste are well documented and not going away. While consumer and commercial recycling of plastic is widespread in many areas, this is not a long-term solution.
“We will not recycle our way out of the plastic pollution crisis: we need a systemic transformation to achieve the transition to a circular economy”
Inger Andersen, UN environment programme executive director
  
To realise the systemic change in society needed to eliminate plastic pollution, there must be the political will. As with many environmental causes, there is the need to battle against the economic forces that have got us to where we are today: there is no financial incentive to reduce plastic waste, so the problem can only be solved through regulation by governments.
For this regulation to be put in place, the people must demand it. 

## To which concrete problem should a solution be found?
People do not know enough about the effects of plastic pollution.

## Which methods / tools from your learning tracks did you use to solve the problem?
A rough draft of the website was made in Figma to get an idea of what the website might look like. We then built our project site using the React JavaScript library. The website was designed with bootstrap and custom CSS styling. All data analysis and data representations were made with python.

## How exactly did you go about it?
To begin this project, we first clearly defined the problem and solution. As mentioned earlier, the problem is that people are not sufficiently informed about the harms and scale of plastic pollution. The solution is to make a well-designed website with clearly presented information and data that can help people make good decisions on plastic use and show what can be done to solve this problem.
The project was divided into two parts. The construction and design of the website by Jack and Krystyna, and the data analysis by Marco.
Website design and construction:

Without any UX/UI designer on our team, Jack took on the role. He first made a rough plan in Figma to get an idea of what the website should look like. This is shown below.

Jack then began work on building the separate web pages in HTML and styling with bootstrap and custom CSS.
In the meantime, Krystyna produced the react project and the framework of the website. She solved the problem of navigation between pages using the React Router. This is a popular solution to this problem which allows the creation of a single page application. Instead of new pages being loaded with new HTTP requests, they are loaded as separate react components.

### Data Analysis:

Marco made all plots and figures using python.

### Coming together:

Once we had completed our separate parts of the project. They could be put together. The HTML written by Jack was converted to JSX and copied into the react project made by Krystyna. We also copied the custom CSS file into the project and linked it to the Index.js file. With a little help from our mentor Davide, it worked first time. Beautiful.

Marco’s data could now be added into the Country Data page. We made a new navigation inside the page for each country’s data. This used the same React Router tool we used for the individual pages. Having made this work before, there were no problems, and it was running in no time.

## Results:
–  What exactly is your solution to the problem? 
We have built a functioning website, soon to be deployed on GitHub Pages. It informs the reader of the problems of plastic pollution, while also offering advice on things they can do to help. 
–  What are the key findings of your project? 
–  What is the impact of your results?
