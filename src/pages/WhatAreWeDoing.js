                It’s entirely possible to meet UNEP’s ambitious goal of reducing plastic waste by 80% in the next two decades. The changes we need to make as consumers are necessary, affordable, and achievable by implementing three market shifts.
                <br></br><br></br>
                Eliminating unnecessary common plastics such as excessive packaging is the first step, according to UNEP’s “Turning off the Tap” report. Reusing refillable bottles for example, in addition to enhancing recycling and turning to greener alternatives, are among the report’s recommendations.
                <br></br><br></br>
                If we can reduce production that would significantly help. And then hopefully, as behavioral change increases, we then use alternatives, or we go back to what we used in the past
                <br></br><br></br>
                We need to identify which are the plastics that we still need, and we need to improve infrastructure to recycle. … We cannot rely solely on recycling to fix the problem.
                <br></br><br></br>
                Not all plastics are made the same either. So, identifying what type of materials can be recycled — and where — is key. A variety of economic, social, and cultural reasons, including infrastructure, are part of why recycling isn’t always ideal.
                <br></br><br></br>
                However, if consumers and corporations transition to plastic alternatives that are less harmful to the environment that would help, a process the report describes as reorientation and diversification.

              Transitioning away from plastics saves money and creates jobs

          <div
            id="panelsStayOpen-collapseTwo"

                With an estimated annual financial risk of $100 billion for businesses dealing with waste management, circularity in plastics — or put simply, using plastics more efficiently — could save $4.5 trillion in environmental and social costs in the next 17 years, as underscored in UNEP’s report.
                <br></br><br></br>
                The transition would also create opportunities for jobs, income, and innovation by 2040. That’s an estimated 700,000 additional jobs and improved livelihoods for millions of workers in developing countries directly associated with short-lived plastics, according to the report.
                <br></br><br></br>
                Still, a lot of work will be needed to manage 100 million metric tons of plastics from short-lived products yearly by 2040. If government policies fail to support shifting away from plastic production and overconsumption, countries will be left in the lurch with 227 million tons of plastic management versus 40 million tons, per the report.
                <br></br><br></br>
                With plastic packaging virtually everywhere, every person on average uses 45 kilograms, which I think is 90 [to a 100] pounds of plastic per year.
